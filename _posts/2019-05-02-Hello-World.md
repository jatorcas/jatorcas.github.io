Today my internship offer as a Data Scientist Intern, with 0 data science experience, was rescinded because I am incapable of peeing in a cup. Here's to starting my adventure through Kaggle!

First things first: I will be taking Kaggle's Intro to Machine Learning microcourse then working through the Titanic Problem.

Intro to Machine Learn - Level 1

1. How Models Work
2. Basic Data Exploration
3. Exercise: Basic Data Exploration
4. Your First Machine Learning Model
5. Exercise: Your First Machine Learning Model
6. Model Validation
7. Exercise: Model Validation
8. Underfitting and Overfitting
9. Exercise: Underfitting and Overfitting
10. Random Forests
11. Exercise: Random Forests
12. Exercise: Machine Learning Competitions

Took about 2 hours to complete - definitely worth it. Finally, I got some exposure to coding, not just watching videos!
