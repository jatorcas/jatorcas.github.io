title: October 31, 2019 - Starting SWE Job Search
---

Today I begin my journey of becoming one of the most skilled software developers in the US! Just kidding, kind of. It's really frustrating consistently not making it passed the screening processes of countless companies solely because I'm only a cs minor, but I just don't have the time or the money to be a double major at this point. It's too late.

I plan on applying to over 200 fulltime SWE positions and documenting every company I get traction with. I know I can execute when it comes time to interview; it's just a matter of getting there. Here's to (hopefully) many more updates!
